# STAC Collections

CyVerse features a set of public datasets that are curated in the CyVerse DataStore.

The assets are primarily available from the DataStore over the public WebDAV

https://data.cyverse.org/dav-anon/

All assets must be shared as `read-only` with the `anonymous` user in the iRODS environment (accessed via the Discovery Environment, Share Data feature) in order for them to be visible and downloadable.
